This dataset should ideally cover a diverse range of apps and user experiences.\n\n2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n   - Analyze the length of the reviews: Understanding the distribution of review lengths can provide insights into users' willingness to provide detailed feedback.\n   - Analyze review ratings: Explore the distribution of ratings to identify any patterns or trends.\n\n3. **Label Sentiment Data:**\n   - Utilize tools like Textblob or NLTK to label the sentiment of each review. These tools can automatically classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the language used.\n\n4. **Understand Overall Sentiment Distribution:**\n   - Evaluate the distribution of sentiments in the dataset. Understanding the overall sentiment breakdown provides a high-level view of user satisfaction.\n\n5. **Explore Relationship Between Sentiments and Ratings:**\n   - Investigate how sentiments align with the given ratings. This step can reveal whether users tend to express sentiments that correspond to their numerical ratings.\n\n6. **Analyze Review Text:**\n   - Dive into the text of reviews to identify common themes or frequently used words associated with different sentiment categories. This qualitative analysis can offer more detailed insights into user opinions.\n\nBy following this systematic process, you can gain a nuanced understanding of user sentiments in app reviews. These insights can be invaluable for developers and businesses aiming to enhance their apps, address specific issues, and improve overall user satisfaction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**To kick off the app reviews sentiment analysis task, let's begin by importing the essential Python libraries and loading the dataset:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the dataset\nlinkedin_data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/linkedin-analysis/linkedin-reviews.csv\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of the dataset\nprint(linkedin_data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-03T06:44:44.668781Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-03T06:44:44.669165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.743788Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-03T06:44:44.669134Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.743026Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(linkedin_data.info())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.745591Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.746410Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.771020Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.746378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-03T06:44:45.770282Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**The dataset comprises two columns: \"Review\" and \"Rating.\" In the \"Review\" column, you'll find textual feedback, while the \"Rating\" column holds corresponding numerical ratings.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n\n**Now, let's delve into this dataset step by step.
